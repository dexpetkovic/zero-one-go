# Zero, One, GO!

Zero, One, GO! is a step by step tutorial aimed at beginners in Go.

It offers an (opinionated) guide on how to create a simple library using Go.

The tutorial will be gradually extended to offer more and more content.

## About this tutorial

In this tutorial I tried to capture learnings of Go I have acquired while doing an interview for a major FinTech company.

I will try to give simple explanations of code snippets that can be used for rapid getting started and development in Go.

The end goal of the tutorial is to create a library that abstracts away a REST API and gives user an ability to use the API without knowing anything about it's implementation.

## Titles

I recommend reading the tutorial in this order:

* [Getting Started](getting-started/README.md)
* [Writing Tests](writing-tests/README.md)
